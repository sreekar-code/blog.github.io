  <p>I have always been a non-fiction fan. Learning something new, diving deep into it, discussing it, and debating itâ€”that's how I keep the curious-me happy!</p>
<p>However, the curious-me also wanted to explore fiction. And I did tryâ€”not once, not twice, but multiple times. Yet, I could never enjoy reading fiction.</p>
<p>But but but....something happened recently! I read a couple of novelsâ€”<a href='https://amzn.in/d/g6PqJgO' target='_blank'>The Sun is Also a Star</a> by Nicola Yoon, and <a href='https://amzn.in/d/auxSBPg' target='_blank'>A Man Called Ove</a> by Fredrik Backmanâ€”and I enjoyed them!</p>
<p>This got me thinkingâ€”what was different this time? Why did these novels click with me?</p>
<p>I pondered over these questions plus all my failed attempts at fiction and I made some interesting observations:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>No slow burns for meâ€”I need the plot to keep moving!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Characters are way more interesting to me than settings. I'd rather delve into a character's life than read a bunch of scenic descriptions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I hate high-end vocab. Simple, easy-to-understand wordsâ€”that's what I prefer.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Book length doesn't bother me, but I like my chapters short and sweetâ€”ten pages tops.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Plus, brownie points if the story has an element of suspense.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, these are my current reading preferences, though I'm sure they'll evolve as I read more.</p>
<p>For now, I'm sticking to stories that match my taste, but who knows? Maybe I'll venture out of my comfort zone soon.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm reading <a href='https://amzn.in/d/7Mzv86n' target='_blank'>Anxious People</a>â€”another amazing book by Fredrik Backman. It's packed into 74 short chapters, each only a few pages long. I've breezed through about ten chapters and I'm already in love with it! ðŸ«¶</p>

<p>Recently, I picked up the book <a href='https://www.amazon.in/Anything-You-Want-Derek-Sivers/dp/0241209048' target='_blank'>Anything You Want</a> by Derek Sivers. It's about CD Baby—biz that Derek deliberately didn't grow!</p>
<p>Okay, I know what's running in your mind now. And trust me, I had the same question: Why would anyone on earth choose not to grow their business?</p>
<p>I gave it some thought and came up with a few reasons but none of them were convincing. 🥲</p>
<p>And while I was still battling with this question, I bumped into a <a href='https://youtu.be/AQDWb0wPXTk' target='_blank'>video</a> of Barbell Biryani, a Telugu Fitness YouTube channel.</p>
<p>I don't know that YouTuber's name (he never revealed). So to keep things simple, I'm gonna call him "Barbell" in this blog post.</p>
<p>Okay, back to the video. So, Barbell said he's gonna reduce the frequency of videos on both his YouTube channels for a while. (Yes, he's got another channel too)</p>
<p>And guess what? My lill' brain now entertained another question: Why would anyone choose to make fewer videos when their YouTube channel is on fire? 🤔</p>
<p>Stressing my messed-up mind, I found out that both the questions were related! Barbell kinda chose not to grow! Okay, just for a while, but still!</p>
<p>Watching the video further, I discovered that Barbell has a lot on his plate lately, so he decided to slow down a bit. Makes sense!</p>
<p>But Derek? He didn't grow his biz at all! He only embraced natural growth! And never made any deliberate effort to accelerate things. Why? Why would you do that, Derek?</p>
<p>To find the answer, I re-read the introduction of the book. And guess what? Derek did mention why he did what he did!</p>
<p>Derek chose not to speed up things with CD Baby 'coz he was already living his dream life being a musician. And he just wanted to help other musicians. Making loads of money was never his goal! (Yeah, I overlooked this part. Don't be like me! 🙈)</p>
<p>I tried to relate both Derek's and Barbell's stories. And some magic happened! ✨</p>
<p>I discovered 3 convincing reasons why one would choose not to grow their business.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not the utmost priority</li>
</ol>
<p>In life, you gotta deal with different things—health, academics, job, family, friends, and a lot more. And your biz may not always top the priority list.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>To avoid burnout</li>
</ol>
<p>When you have already got a lot on your plate, trying to grow your biz would be biting off more than you could chew.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Just want natural growth</li>
</ol>
<p>Not chasing something, just going with the flow—yeah, why not? If that's what keeps you happy.</p>
<p>And these reasons led to my answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Barbell chose to make fewer videos 'coz YouTube is not his utmost priority lately and he wanna avoid burnout.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Derek chose not to grow CD Baby 'coz he just wanted to go with the flow, embracing natural growth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And guess what? These answers made me realize a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Prioritizing things + taking care of your mental well-being is growth too. That's what Barbell did!</p>
</li>
<li><p>Going with the flow + embracing natural growth is growth too. That's what Derek did!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both Barbell and Derek chose not to grow their business but you know what? They did grow—just in different areas of life!</p>
<p>And finally, these realizations led to an incredible insight:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you know WHY you are doing WHAT you are doing, then choosing not to grow is growth too! 💫</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So yeah, got the reasons, answers, realizations, and a bonus insight! Finally, happy me! 😄</p>

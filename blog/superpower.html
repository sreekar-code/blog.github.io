<p>When it comes to personal projects, I don't flirt with ideas. I jump into execution. But once executed, I don't continue putting effort into it.</p>
<p>For instance, I didn't think twice before shooting my first YouTube video about coffee. I just hit the record button, yapped for a few minutes, and uploaded it. The following days, I shot a bunch and uploaded them too. And then, nothing — no videos!</p>
<p>The same happened with other personal projects: newsletter for freelancers, chess newsletter, coffee blog, coffee reels, vibe coding apps, and many more.</p>
<p>These short bursts of obsession followed by absolute inaction is my biggest problem with personal projects.</p>
<p>I often felt bad about this pattern of mine. But now, I feel different. I feel it could be my superpower. Thanks to the conversation I had with Ibraheem today.</p>
<p>Crux of our discussion: Automate stuff with agentic AI.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To automate stuff, you need to figure out what you can automate. <br>
To know what to automate, you gotta find that repeated pattern. <br>
To find that repeated pattern, you need to try shit. <br>
To try shit, you need to get started.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I get started the moment an idea pops into my head. So, I can try shit. I can find that repeated pattern. I can automate stuff.</p>
<p>And if I can automate stuff (at least a few things), maybe I can be consistent in putting effort into my personal projects.</p>
<p>Let's say I automated the following tasks with an AI agent:</p>
<ul>
<li>Finding coffee-related topics with more search volume</li>
<li>Generating scripts on those topics</li>
<li>Creating animated videos</li>
<li>Uploading them</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if I could just automate the first two steps, maybe I could stay consistent with publishing videos on my coffee channel?</p>
<p>I don't know. Maybe or maybe not. But I like thinking in this way now — automating stuff with agentic AI. Sounds pretty exciting!</p>
<p>I'm gonna keep this in mind for my next personal project and try it out. Let's see if I can solve my consistency problem.</p>

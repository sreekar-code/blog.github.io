<p>It was 2021...</p>
<p>Me: I want to become a freelance content writer.</p>
<p>My dad, relatives, and society: It's a difficult path! Choose an easy one.</p>
<p>Me: But this is what I want to do!</p>
<p>My dad, relatives, and society: You never listen to me.</p>
<p>A year later, when I was reading <a href="https://www.amazon.in/Subtle-Art-Not-Giving/dp/0062641549" target="_blank">The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck</a> by Mark Manson, I found this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every path is difficult. Choose the path with difficulties you want to deal with.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Every path, no matter how easy or safe it appears, has difficulties. A government job has difficulties. A software engineer faces difficulties. And a writer like me, battles difficulties.</p>
<p>But I want to deal with the difficulties that come with freelance content writing. And that's exactly what makes it an easy path for me.</p>
<p>So, I did choose an easy path, an <em>easy path for me</em>!</p>
<p>Turns out, I did listen to my dad, relatives, and society but just not how they expected. 😅</p>

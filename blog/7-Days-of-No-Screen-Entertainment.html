<p>Okay, it was harder than I thought! 😅</p>
<p>But guess what? It was rewarding too! 🤌</p>
<p>I started off this week with <a href="No-Screen-Entertainment-for-a-Week.html">no-screen-entertainment</a>! And throughout the week, I didn't open YouTube, Instagram, or any OTT platform. Also, on WhatsApp, I texted only when it was necessary.</p>
<p>I did this experiment to avoid screen fatigue but ended up with a ton of other benefits too! And some challenges too! 😬</p>
<p>So, here's the scoop on what went well and what didn't with no-screen-entertainment.</p>
<h2 id=what-went-well>What Went Well?</h2><h3 id=1-focused-work>#1: Focused Work</h3><p>Recently, I got a freelance gig to pen a blog related to Incident Management software. And I knew nothing about Incident Management! 😬</p>
<p>So, I studied everything about Incident Management from scratch! In 4 days, I picked up all the basics, played around with different Incident Management software, went through user reviews, and read all the related top-raking blogs.</p>
<p>And guess what? I even found a bug in my client's Incident Management software! 😎</p>
<p>From knowing nothing to finding a bug—it wouldn't have been possible without the deep work sessions I did through this experiment!</p>
<h3 id=2-conscious-eating>#2 Conscious Eating</h3><p>Watching movies/web series while eating was my biggest guilty pleasure! I always wanted to get rid of it but couldn't do so. 🥲</p>
<p>However, this experiment did the trick! I ate every meal devoid of the screen. And trust me, it's the best thing that this experiment yielded!</p>
<p>I became conscious of what I was eating and how much I was eating.</p>
<p>And guess what? Morning coffee tastes 10x better without a screen!</p>
<h3 id=3-no-mindless-scrolling>#3 No Mindless Scrolling</h3><p>YouTube Shorts! Although they are called shorts, they eat up a hell lot of time. And the worst part? It's all mindless scrolling!</p>
<p>But thanks to my no-screen-entertainment experiment, I could finally escape that never-ending loop!</p>
<h3 id=4-more-time-with-mom>#4 More Time With Mom</h3><p>On one of the days this week, I was on a call with a friend when I spotted my mom looking all worried in the apartment's walkway. I wrapped up the call and headed her way.</p>
<p>I asked what was up, and she spilled that she'd had a rough day. I was like, "Why didn't you tell me earlier?" She replied with, "You seemed caught up, didn't want to bother you."</p>
<p>And that got me thinking—how many times has she held back from chatting with me while I was simply zoning out to YouTube videos in my room, and she assumed I was busy working?</p>
<p>That's it! I decided to spend more time with my mom. And from the next day, we had tea together, went for walks, talked about our work, and even bitched about my grandmother! 😂</p>
<h3 id=5-head-over-heels-for-fiction>#5 Head Over Heels For Fiction</h3><p>Hands down, reading is 100x more immersive than watching!</p>
<p>I picked up "Here, There, and Everywhere" by Sudha Murthy. And you won't believe it—I journeyed all across India through her tales. That's how immersive it was!</p>
<p>One of the short stories in that book—Three Thousand Stitches—has my heart! I was all in tears when I read it! 🥹</p>
<p>Skipping those random crappy movies and web series for a short story? Trust me, it's way more satisfying!</p>
<p>Okay, now, it's time for</p>
<h2 id=what-didn-t-go-well>What Didn't Go Well?</h2><h3 id=1-missed-movies>#1 Missed Movies</h3><p>Yes, reading is way more immersive than watching but I do love watching movies! 😅</p>
<p>Random crappy movie? Nah, I'd go with a short story! But a good movie, I'd love to watch it! And I did miss movies this week. 🥲</p>
<h3 id=2-no-crazy-convos>#2 No Crazy Convos</h3><p>Throughout this week, I used WhatsApp sparingly. I texted only when it was necessary. And if a reaction would do, I just reacted.</p>
<p>Although I enjoyed my friends getting annoyed by my new WhatsApp style, I did miss those fun crazy convos we usually have!</p>
<h3 id=3-loneliness>#3 Loneliness</h3><p>By Friday, I was seriously reaching my limit! I was in the mood for some entertainment. Sure, I had books around, but I was looking for something more. And before I knew it, loneliness started creeping in.</p>
<p>I tried to shake it off by going for a loooooong walk, but even then, that sense of loneliness hung around like a stubborn cloud.</p>
<p>So, that's the breakdown of the ups and downs of my no-screen-entertainment journey!</p>
<h2 id=final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</h2><p>This was one of the toughest and coolest experiments I've ever taken on. I soaked up a ton of lessons from it.</p>
<p>And I'm gonna continue it but with a few tweaks:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll watch one or two movies in a week.</li>
<li>I'll only hop on YouTube when I really need to.</li>
<li>And I'll get back to my old WhatsApping style but would still stick to no oversharing.</li>
</ul>
<p>And that's it, folks!</p>
<p>If you're up for giving the whole no-screen-entertainment thing a shot, go ahead! You'll have a lot of fun and learn a great deal of things along the way!</p>
<p>See ya in the next post!</p>

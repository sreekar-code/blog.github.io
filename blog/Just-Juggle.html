   <p>The other day, I wrote a post on <a href="Same-Mistake,-Different-Form.html">balancing entertainment and work</a>. If you haven't read it, here's the gist:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Too much entertainment is a problem. </br>
No/too little entertainment is not the solution. </br>
Balancing entertainment and work is the solution.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, here's an interesting question: Do I already know that balance is the solution? Of course! So, why did I fuck up? Because I just couldn't strike the balance!</p>
<p>When <a href='https://www.primevideo.com/detail/0F7ITN3V63GVKYSF4U36GEXRT8/ref=atv_sr_fle_c_Tn74RA_1_1_1?sr=1-1&amp;pageTypeIdSource=ASIN&amp;pageTypeId=B0CVKDS3RQ&amp;qid=1717950503446' target='_blank'>Panchayat season 3</a> was released, I got super excited and binge-watched it! The result? My productivity took a hit!</p>
<p>Ideally, I should have watched only one or two episodes per day and kept up with my work. But no, I just binge-watched the whole thing!</p>
<p>I know what I should have done, yet I didn't. So, what does this say? The solution—Balance—doesn't always work!</p>
<p>And guess what? That's OKAY!</p>
<p>It's okay to binge-watch a show I love. It's okay to be less productive on some days. It's okay to not perfectly balance entertainment and work every single day.</p>
<p>Life's like juggling a bunch of different balls—work, fun, health, me-time, family time, and more. And let's be real, we can't always keep all those balls in the air. We can just juggle them, meaning we catch the falling ball!</p>
<p>If you're spending too much time on entertainment, the work ball falls down. And all you gotta do is catch it and keep it in the juggle again!</p>
<p>But what if you fail to catch one of those balls? That's okay too! We are humans and we fuck up! Just pick up the ball and juggle again!</p>
<p>Just juggle!</p>
<p>P.S. Shoutout to Howard H. Stevenson and his Harvard lecture on <a href='https://youtu.be/wLn28DrSF68?feature=shared' target='_blank'>Building a life</a> for inspiring me to write this post.</p>

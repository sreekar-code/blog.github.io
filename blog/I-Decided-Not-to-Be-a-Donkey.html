<p>I just picked up the book "Tools of Titans" by Tim Ferris. It's a collection of Tim's podcast summaries.</p>

<p>I started off with the episode featuring Derek Sivers.</p>

<p>From business to life, Derek and Tim discussed some really cool stuff.</p>

<p>When Tim asked Derek what advice he would give to his 30-year-old self, Derek said "Don't be a donkey".</p>

<p>Yeah, that shocked me too!😅</p>

<p>But as I read further, I discovered Derek was referring to the Buridan's Donkey.</p>

<p>Buridan's Donkey is that donkey who couldn't decide between hay and water and died of both hunger and thirst.<p/>

<p>Derek gave this reference to explain his point:</p>

<blockquote>You can't do all at a time and make progress. However, you can do one for a few years, and then do another for a few years, and then another. And eventually, you'll be able to do everything you want!

</blockquote>

<p>I loved this perspective! 🤌</p>

<p>Lately, I've been working on multiple personal projects. And I'm trying to stay consistent with all of them but couldn't do so. Now, I understand why. I'm just being a donkey!</p>

<p>I should rather focus on one thing and make significant progress before I jump to another.</p>

<p>So, yeah, not gonna be a donkey anymore!</p>

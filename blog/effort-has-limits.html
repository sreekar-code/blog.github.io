<p>Lately, I don't feel like doing anything for anyone, and that includes myself.</p>
<p>But I wasn't like this. I was someone who would go to any length for my loved ones.</p>
<p>I used to check in on my friends often, travel miles to meet them, listen to them, console them, and do everything I could.</p>
<p>But now, I just don't want to. I feel like all my emotional reserve is drained out. I'm exhausted.</p>
<p>And I've come to a point where I don't even feel like putting effort for myself.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have emptied all my emotional reserve. I should have prioritized myself, too.</p>
<p>I know that this is just a phase and it'll pass. But it's gonna take some time, and that's okay.</p>
<p>I learned that effort has limits, and exhausting it would make things difficult for people around me and myself.</p>

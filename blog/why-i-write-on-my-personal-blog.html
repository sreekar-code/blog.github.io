      I'm a freelance content writer.

      I write for companies.

      I write on my LinkedIn.

      And I write on my Twitter.

      So, I write more, and write often!
  
  </p>

  <p>

     Yet, I still write on my personal blog.

  </p>

  <p> 

     Why?

  </p

  <p>

     Because unlike companies and social media, my blog lets me write whatever I want to write with no strings attached.

 </p>

 <p>

    On my blog, I dump ideas, share my thoughts, and express what I truly feel.
</p>

<p>

    Plus, I don't convince anyone into anything, please anyone, seek validation from anyone, or worry to be politically correct.

 </p>

 <p>
     I write! I just write!
 </p> 
    
 <p>

   And this freedom to write whatever the fuck I want to write is why I write on my personal blog.

<p>2 reasons!</p>
<p>One, to feel lighter!</p>
<p>Two, to build healthy relationships.</p>
<p>The first one is pretty obvious! So, let's dive into the latter.</p>
<p>When you openly share your feelings, you're basically giving your loved ones the information about why you feel the way you feel.</p>
<p>And this piece of information is gold! It helps your loved ones know how to respond, making it easier for them to support and care for you.</p>
<p>In simple words, by expressing your feelings, you're helping your loved ones love you even better.</p>
<p>Over time, as you keep sharing this emotional data, they get better at understanding you. And you may not be required to spell it out every time.</p>
<p>But remember, the initial step is to speak your heart and mind out.</p>
<p>Also, encourage your loved ones to do the same!</p>
<p>This two-way exchange of emotions lays the foundation for healthy and meaningful relationships.</p>
<p>So, in a nutshell, expressing what you feel not only takes the weight off your shoulders but also strengthens the bonds you share with your loved ones.</p>

<p>Hyderabad is known for 2 things!</p>
<p>One, Biryani. The other, Chai (Tea).</p>
<p>Although I'm from Hyderabad, I was never a fan of chai. I always loved coffee. ☕️</p>
<p>Why? 2 reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>That bitterness coffee has 🤌</li>
<li>The energy boost it gives 💪</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust me, give me 90 minutes after a cup of coffee, and I'm a productivity machine!</p>
<p>But lately, I've been exploring chai. And I noticed something chai can do to Hyderabadis that coffee can't.</p>
<p>Chai brings people together like nothing else!</p>
<p>In Hyderabad, hardly anyone sips chai solo. You'll usually find a group of friends or colleagues hanging out at the chai dukaan (tea shop), enjoying their chai.</p>
<p>And guess what? People even travel 20-30 km just for that special chai from a particular chai dukaan.</p>
<p>Chai isn't just a beverage for us Hyderabadi folks—it's an experience! 🫶</p>
<p>Conversely, coffee is more of a solo vibe for most people.</p>
<p>If you find a group at a coffee shop in Hyderabad, they're probably there for a work session or a meeting.</p>
<p>When you swing by Hyderabad, chances for someone asking, "Chai peene chale" (Let's grab a chai) are more than heading out for coffee.</p>
<p>So, that's the magic of chai for us Hyderabadis—it brings us together in a unique way!</p>
<p>But for me? I enjoy both—chai with the gang and coffee alone.</p>

<p>24th December 2025, 6:45 PM — I signed off from work in 2025!</p>
<p>I've got 8 fucking days to do anything or absolutely nothing!</p>
<p>I'm super grateful to our company for giving a complete week off at the year end.</p>
<p>I don't remember when was the last time I didn't think about work for a whole fucking week.</p>
<p>For these 8 days — I've got no plans. And this feels soooo gooooooood!!! 😌</p>
<p>Each day, I'll wake up and I'll just do what I feel like.</p>
<p>If I feel like going for a run, I'll go. If not, fuck it!<p>
<p></p>If I feel like reading, I'll read. If not, fuck it!<p>
<p></p>If I feel like visiting a cafe, I'll go. If not, fuck it!</p>
<p>I'll just do what I feel like! 😌</p>
<p>Btw, today was the first day, and I felt like going out, restocking my coffee beans, and sipping coffee at Toops Coffee. And I did all those!</p>
<p>Tomorrow? Who knows! I'll deal tomorrow tomorrow!</p>
<p>Good night, folks! 😴</p>

<p>Start with something small they say! Why? 'Coz it's easy they say! But is it?</p>
<p>I was just leafing through the pages of "Tools of Titans" and bumped into the podcast episode featuring Seth Godin.</p>
<p>Godin too recommends starting something small. But his reason's a little offbeat! He suggests starting small not because it's easy but risky!</p>
<p>Okay, I had the same WTF expression as you! 😂</p>
<p>But guess what? As I read further, my WTF expression turned into an oooo-I-see expression.</p>
<p>Godin says "Small is risky because it's achievable and if you fail, you're really screwed up. But big? Big is safe! It gives you a place to hide!"</p>
<p>When you pick small and fail, you hear a thousand mocking comments. And loads of embarrassment weigh you down. Whereas, if you pick big and fail, hardly anyone makes fun of you 'coz people perceive achieving big as difficult.</p>
<p>But on the contrary, small is more difficult than big. Why? 'coz the stakes are higher when you pick small.</p>
<p>So, small's not easy, my friend! It's difficult. It's risky. And it demands a hell lot of courage. That's why you gotta start something small!</p>
<p>Okay, is that oooo-I-see expression on your face? 😉</p>

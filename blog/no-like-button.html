<p>I took the pain (also pleasure) of building this blog from scratch—writing code and self-hosting it on a Raspberry Pi.</p>
<p>However, I have decided never to include a "Like Button" on this blog.</p>
<p>Why? Because I want to write here just for the sake of writing.</p>
<p>I already deal with the effects of instant dopamine hits (likes) on social media and I really don't want the same for my blog.</p>
<p>I'd be happy if someone reads my blog and texts me how they feel about it, but I don't want to open my blog multiple times a day just to see how many people liked it.</p>
<p>So, no like button for my blog ever!</p>
<p>P.S. It kinda feels nice to have this "Mah blog mah rules" autonomy! 😎</p>

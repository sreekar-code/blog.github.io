<p>The past few days were rough. It was one of the worst phases of my life.</p>
<p>But things are finally falling into place now. It's getting better.</p>
<p>And to keep this up, I decided to get back to the things I love—reading, chess, and writing.</p>
<p>I picked up the book "Red Rising" by Pierce Brown, and it's quite engaging.</p>
<p>Though it says sci-fi on the cover, I feel it's a multi-genre novel. It has got a love story, revenge, politics, philosophy, and of course, sci-fi elements.</p>
<p>I already finished 20% of the book, and it's hard to put down.</p>
<p>I'm just glad I found such an engaging book. It's helping me get out of the reading slump.</p>
<p>Also, I bought a chess book, "How to Win at Chess" by Levy Rozman. It covers all the basics, strategies, openings, endgame theory, and more. Perfect for beginners and intermediate-level players.</p>
<p>I've been playing chess on and off for 17 years now, but I never studied the theory in a structured manner. So, picked up this book.</p>
<p>Though I already know a lot of the stuff discussed in this book, absorbing information in a structured way is helping me connect the dots in the right order.</p>
<p>Also, I bumped into a fellow chess enthusiast on Twitter, and we're launching a chess newsletter soon. Super excited for this. More deets coming soon.</p>
<p>And finally, writing. I built this blog to pen my heart and mind out, but I haven't been doing that. But not anymore. I decided to write regularly here.</p>
<p>I don't know what topics I will write about, but I will write. If I don't find anything, I'll just dump how my day or week went. But I will write!</p>
<p>See you again.</p>

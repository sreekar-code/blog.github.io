<p>Recently, our boys' gang (<a href="https://aravindballa.com/" target="_blank">Aravind</a>, <a href="https://vcafe.beehiiv.com/" target="_blank">Vik</a>, <a href="https://x.com/whoibrar" target="_blank">Ibraheem</a>, and I) went on a workation to Lonavala.</p>
<p>We all had an amazing time! We worked on different projects, played mindfuck board games, had crazy late-night conversations, and even went on a hike!</p>
<p>On our way back to Hyderabad, Ibraheem asked me a question: What's the one thing you take from this trip?</p>
<p>And before I could answer it, Ibraheem being Ibraheem jumped onto another topic.</p>
<p>So, I decided to answer it now! (Ibraheem, pay attention! 😂)</p>
<p>I'm someone who always lived with my parents and never stayed in a hostel. So, I've been pretty pampered. And my tolerance for discomfort? Not great! 😅</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of eating just anywhere, I prefer buses over trains, and road-side public restrooms? No, thank you.</p>
<p>But during this trip, I ended up doing all those things and even more!</p>
<p>What pushed me? Ibraheem's randomly dropped words (yes, I pay attention! 😂)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Increase your tolerance level and you can explore more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And it's so true! Every time I pushed my limits in the trip, I got to explore and experience more.</p>
<p>So, if I have to take one thing from this trip, it's this: Increasing my tolerance level and exploring more things.</p>
<p>To new experiences! 🥂</p>

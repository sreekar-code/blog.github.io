<p>I'm a freelance content writer. I write for businesses. But this was not how I began my writing journey.</p>
<p>I started off with articles, short stories, and poems—sharing my thoughts on various topics.</p>
<p>I wrote articles about failure, forgiveness, and silence. I wrote short stories on love, empathy, and social conditioning. I wrote poems on body shaming, mental health, and more.</p>
<p>But lately, all I'm doing is writing for businesses. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy it. I love my job!</p>
<p>However, I don't want my words to only serve businesses. I want my words to mean more, serve more, and help more.</p>
<p>So, I've made up my mind. I'm gonna write about those meaningful topics again! I'll post them on my blog, and maybe, just maybe, make some difference!</p>

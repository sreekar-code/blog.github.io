  <p>When I tell people I'm 26, I hear two narratives.</p>
<p>Narrative 1: You've got plenty of time!</p>
<p>Narrative 2: You're running out of time!</p>
<p>Which is true?</p>
<p>I battled this question for a long time until I found the answer in a <a href="https://sive.rs/run2" target="_blank">blog post</a> by Derek Sivers.</p>
<p>The answer: Neither!</p>
<p>I neither have plenty of time nor am running out of time.</p>
<p>But believing I have time makes me less anxious. And I work better when I'm less anxious.</p>
<p>This might not be the case for everyone. Some people need the pressure of a ticking clock to get things done.</p>
<p>So, the real question is: Which narrative should you <em>believe in</em>?</p>
<p>Derek, in his blog post, said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Beliefs are useful, not true. Choose the belief that makes you take the action you want.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to work well. I work well when I'm less anxious. I'm less anxious when I believe I have time. So, I chose to believe in the first narrative.</p>
<p>What about you? Which narrative do you believe in?</p>

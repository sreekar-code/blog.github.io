<p>I was a straight-A student. I always secured a 9+ GPA. Even when I was hospitalized and couldn't attend classes during a semester, I still managed to get a 9.4 GPA.</p>
<p>But after graduation, I ditched the traditional path and switched to an offbeat career. I started all over from scratch.</p>
<p>It's been four years and I'm not where I planned to be. I know someday I will make it but right now, I'm not there yet.</p>
<p>This sometimes makes me feel sad, and the fact that I was a straight-A student makes it even harder.</p>
<p>However, I found a way to deal with this. All thanks to Derek Sivers.</p>
<p>In a <a href='https://youtu.be/0BaDQCjqUHU?feature=shared' target='_blank'>podcast</a>, Derek said</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Somebody who was an athlete in school can't keep calling themselves an athlete forever. Either you have to keep earning that title or admit that you are no longer an athlete and redefine yourself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This made me realize that my "straight-A student" identity is expired. I can't cling to it forever. It's an unnecessary burden that only adds more pressure.</p>
<p>So, I decided to let go of that outdated identity, and I’m redefining myself—one day at a time—feeling lighter and more at peace each day.</p>

<p>Books gave me many things. But the best of all is introducing me to <a href="https://x.com/learnwithvidya" target="_blank">Vidya</a>.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Vidya launched <a href='https://www.instagram.com/hyderabadbookclub/' target='_blank'>Hyderabad Bookclub</a> and I attended its inaugural session. It was there I met this wonderful person.</p>
<p>And fast forward to now, Vidya's one of my closest friends.</p>
<p>In these two years, I have seen Vidya—the encyclopedia, Vidya—the funny, Vidya—the kind, Vidya—the fearless, Vidya—our gang's mom, Vidya—the jack of all trades, and more.</p>
<p>It's like meeting her doppelgangers from parallel universes. And you know what? All of them are super sweet!</p>
<p>Her lengthy texts, super cautiousness about being on time for trains, fearless frankness, I'm-gonna-kill-you silence, kid-like excitement for little things—I just love everything!</p>
<p>The best part? Vidya's one of those friends who says things to your face with absolute honesty. And the very next moment, you're jolted back to reality! What more could you ask for in a friend?</p>
<p>I'm just glad our paths crossed. She’s one of the best people I’ve ever met.</p>
<p>Next week, Vidya's getting married and I'm super happy for her. I wish her all the happiness in the world.</p>

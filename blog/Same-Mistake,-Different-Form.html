    <h1>Same Mistake, Different Form</h1>

  <p>This week, I watched a web series and a couple of movies. And I didn't do much work.</p>
<p>With my productivity hitting bottom, I realized my mistake—spending too much time on entertainment.</p>
<p>So, I came up with the solution—sign out from all the OTT platforms and get back to work.</p>
<p>But after reading Derek Sivers' blog post—<a href='https://sive.rs/htl27' target='_blank'>Balance Everything</a>—I realized that my solution was actually the same mistake in a different form.</p>
<p>Spending too much time on entertainment, or spending no/too little time on entertainment—both are extremes.</p>
<p>I cannot rectify a mistake by repeating it.</p>
<p>So, the solution? Balance!</p>
<p>I need to balance my entertainment and work. Instead of signing out of OTT platforms, I need to limit my watch time. This allows me to have fun plus work.</p>
<p>To balance! 🥂</p>

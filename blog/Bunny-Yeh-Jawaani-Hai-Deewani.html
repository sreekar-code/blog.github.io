  <p>Main udna chahta hoon, <br>
daudna chahta hoon, <br>
girna bhi chahta hoon...<br>
bus rukna nahi chahta<br></p>
<p>Those words? They completely swept the 17-year-old me off my feet for Bunny!</p>
<p>Back then, Bunny was everything I thought was cool. Traveling world, charming girls, and following heart—he had it all!</p>
<p>Cut to adulthood, Bunny became less cool for me. Why? 'Cause he was always on the move, had no lasting relationships, and barely made any time for friends.</p>
<p>Bunny was lucky though—he had Aditi, Avi, and Naina. They stuck by him, even though he wasn't the best at nurturing friendships.</p>
<p>But the truth is, friendships and relationships require continuous effort. Neglect them, and the dynamics shift, eventually leading to losing your friends.</p>
<p>So, the 25-year-old me now, would totally fall for a Bunny who'd say:</p>
<p>Main udna chahta hoon,<br>
daudna chahta hoon,<br>
girna bhi chahta hoon...<br>
apnon ke saath rehna bhi chahta hoon<br>
chahe iske liye thodi der rukna bhi pade.</p>
<p>And lastly, Bunny, tu right nahi hai, bas reality se bahut alag hai!</p>

<p>I bumped into <a href='https://aravindballa.com/' target='_blank'>Aravind</a> at a book club meetup. And guess what? In less than a year, we are good buddies now!</p>
<p>This guy? Super chill! Seriously, he’s the last person you'd wanna pick a fight with. Cool as a cucumber!</p>
<p>The best part? He's got this knack for saying the right words at the right time!</p>
<p>I'm gonna spill the beans on a few gems he's dropped:</p>
<h3 id=it-s-a-decision-between-adventure-and-comfort>✨ It's a decision between adventure and comfort</h3><p>When I was about to cancel my first solo trip, Aravind said these words. The next thing I knew, I was on a train with my bags packed. That solo trip? It turned out to be an amazing experience! 🫶</p>
<h3 id=haath-ka-mail-hota-hai-paisa-ise-bachate-nahi-kabhi-kabhi-udaate-hai>✨ Haath ka mail hota hai paisa. Ise bachate nahi, kabhi kabhi udaate hai</h3><p>That's the dialogue from Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani but Aravind just tweaked it a bit.</p>
<p>It means money is like the dirt on your hands—you don't hoard it, you sometimes spend it! (Sounds cool in Hindi 😅)</p>
<p>I'm not a spendthrift but I was spending more money on my solo trip and I was all guilty about it. That's when Aravind dropped this dialogue.</p>
<p>And my guilt? Instantly vanished! 😂</p>
<h3 id=seize-those-moments-with-your-friends>✨ Seize those moments with your friends</h3><p>A while back, I met my friends for lunch. We had a blast, but when it was time to split, we couldn’t. So, they suggested a spontaneous night out.</p>
<p>I was hesitant 'coz I had some pending work for a client. But I ended up going.</p>
<p>I wasn’t fully into it, though. That’s when I spilled my thoughts to Aravind, and he said, "As we get older, it’s harder to hang out with friends due to our crazy schedules, so you better seize those moments."</p>
<p>And you know what? I enjoyed the night out and still managed to finish the work on time.</p>
<p>How? Chilling with friends relaxed me, and the next day, I was super productive and nailed the work!</p>
<h3 id=be-a-conductor-of-wealth>✨ Be a conductor of wealth</h3><p>This one Aravind shared with our friend, Ibraheem. Ibraheem was a bit hesitant about easy, legal money-making opportunities.</p>
<p>Aravind's take? Don't stop the money flow. Be a conductor of wealth. Grab those easy money opportunities, and if you don't want it all for yourself, donate some, but keep the money moving.</p>
<p>I don't know about Ibraheem, but I'm all in on this idea!</p>
<h3 id=build-topics-to-talk-about-over-time>✨ Build topics to talk about over time</h3><p>Aravind's in an 8+ year-long relationship. I met his partner, and they're an awesome pair!</p>
<p>I asked him what do they talk about since they're into different things. His answer? Over time, we built amazing topics to talk about.</p>
<p>That reply had my heart! ❤️</p>
<p>I always thought finding someone with the same interests was key, but his perspective changed my view.</p>
<h3 id=categorize-your-tasks-into-energy-giving-and-energy-draining>✨ Categorize your tasks into energy-giving and energy-draining</h3><p>When I was juggling hobbies and work, Aravind suggested this task-sorting trick. And it worked like a charm!</p>
<p>And here's the best one:</p>
<h3 id=you-are-paying-to-try-out-a-different-experience>✨ You are paying to try out a different experience</h3><p>I'm someone who sticks to the same dish at the same restaurant because I fear being disappointed with something new.</p>
<p>But when Aravind said you're paying for a new experience, not just the taste, it blew my mind!</p>
<p>I tried different things later. Some I loved, some I didn't, but I did try new experiences!</p>
<p>I can keep going—Aravind's full of such nuggets of wisdom!</p>
<p>I'm just glad we crossed paths and became pals!</p>

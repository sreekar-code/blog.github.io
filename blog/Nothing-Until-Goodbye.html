<p>One of my friends is moving to a new city for higher education. And tbh, neither of us gave a damn about it.</p>
<p>I was like yeah tomorrow he's going, and he was like yeah I'm going tomorrow. That's how we were throughout the day.</p>
<p>We watched Oppenheimer, ate Shah Ghouse biryani, and returned home. Yeah, just like always.</p>
<p>And then there came a moment!</p>
<p>When we bid goodbye, everything—our 2-3 hour long chats, debates, discussions, movies we watched, projects we built, night walks, bike rides, and restaurants we went to—all flashed in my mind in that one moment.</p>
<p>20 years of friendship! I just relived 20 long years of our friendship in that one moment!</p>
<p>I don't know if he had experienced the same or different or nothing but whatever I did—was beautiful! 🫶</p>

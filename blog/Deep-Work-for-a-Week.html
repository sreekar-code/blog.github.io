<p>Last week, I did an experiment—<a href="7-Days-of-No-Screen-Entertainment.html">no-screen-entertainment</a>. Basically, I ditched screens for fun stuff. Yup, no YouTube, no Insta, no movies, and no web series!</p>
<p>And guess what? I loved the entire experience! 🫶</p>
<p>So, this week, I'm gonna do something similar. But before I reveal what it is, lemme tell you something.</p>
<p>Although I didn't seek any entertainment from screens during the no-screen-entertainment experiment, I sought instant gratification! 😅</p>
<p>I peeked at my LinkedIn notifications, checked out my <a href='https://yourfreelancebuddy.substack.com/' target='_blank'>newsletter</a> dashboard, and hopped onto WhatsApp every now and then!</p>
<p>And whenever someone liked my LinkedIn post or signed up for my newsletter, it gave me that quick happy boost.</p>
<p>I knew it was that instant gratification trap yet I went for it all-knowing! 🙈</p>
<p>Also, it disrupted my workflow sometimes! 🥲</p>
<p>So, this week, I'm gonna flee the instant gratification trap and work with zero interruptions!</p>
<p>How, you ask? Here you go: I'm gonna keep my hands off my phone (except for calls) during my work hours i.e. 11 AM to 5:30 PM. I'm gonna do deep work sessions! And do them for this whole week!</p>
<p>And just like I did last week, on Sunday, I'll let you know how it all went. So, stay tuned!</p>
<p>And hey, wish me luck! 😅</p>

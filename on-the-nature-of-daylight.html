  <p>Six years ago, one of the YouTubers I follow recommended the song—<a href='https://open.spotify.com/track/56oReVXIfUO9xkX7pHmEU0?si=5b648b0dc1da4021' target='_blank'>On the Nature of Daylight</a> by Max Richter</p>
<p>I googled it and found that it was used in the film—Shutter Island, one of my favorites. So with no further thought, I saved it to my playlist.</p>
<p>The same day, while I was traveling on a bus at night, I listened to this song for the first time.</p>
<p>It might sound exaggerating but trust me, throughout the song, I felt a sense of peace I had never experienced before.</p>
<p>The bus was crowded, we were stuck in traffic, people were shouting, and vehicles from behind were honking, but none of those could steal the peace I was experiencing.</p>
<p>And by the end of the song, my eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>Since then, I listened to this song a million times. Though I didn't experience the same again, this song always calmed me down and made me feel better.</p>
<p>I'm just glad that this beautiful song exists and I can listen to it :)</p>

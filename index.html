<p>Hieee! I’m Sreekar. I work as a freelance content writer and strategist. 
    When I’m off work, I binge-watch movies, read books, write poetry, and make cutuu origami art.
</p>
<p>
    “Sreekar Scribbles” is my cozy little playhouse, where I just hang out and pen my heart and mind out.
</p>
<p>
    Everything you see here are those precious moments, thoughts, and emotions that I hold onto tightly, just like a kiddo cuddling their favorite teddy!
</p>
<p>
    This is my safe space, and I'm super excited to have you here! Hope you have a blast! :)

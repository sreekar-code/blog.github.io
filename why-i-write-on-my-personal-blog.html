      I'm a freelance content writer.

      I write for companies.

      I write on my LinkedIn.

      And I write on my Twitter.

      So, I write more, and write often!
  
  </p>

  <p>

     Yet, I still write on my personal blog.

  </p>

  <p> 

     Why?

  </p

  <p>

     Because unlike companies and social media, my blog lets me write what I really want to write. 

     Plus, I get to decide who reads what I write.

 </p>

 <p>

    On my blog, I write about movies, podcasts, YouTube videos, books, and blogs. 

    Plus, I share my happy moments, sad moments, things I like, things I don't like, things I'm excited about, things I'm scared, and things I'm grateful for.

</p>

<p>

    All, while not convincing anyone into anything, pleasing anyone, seeking validation from anyone, or worrying to be politically correct.

 </p>
   
 <p>
 
    And I don't promote my blog.

    I only share it with my close friends.

    They read it and share their views.

    That's enough for me.

    Actually, more than enough!

 </p>


 <p>

   So, this control over what I write plus who can read what I write is why I write on my personal blog.

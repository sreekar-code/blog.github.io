  <p>In 7th grade, my friends and I built a small battery-run boat for the science exhibition held in our school.</p>
<p>We had no idea about electronics, concepts like density, and how the shape of the fan should be so it propels the boat forward.</p>
<p>We just broke a remote-controlled car, took the tiny motor from it, and attached it to our boat. For the shape of the fan, we just did a hundred iterations to figure out what works.</p>
<p>That's how we were—lacking knowledge, inexperienced, but driven by stupid curiosity and mad enthusiasm.</p>
<p>And I was a bit more stupid, crazy than others.</p>
<p>While building the boat, we had a problem with sticking components together. Back then, we didn't know soldering gun existed. All we knew was fevicol, which didn't work.</p>
<p>So, I, the stupidest of all, came up with the idea: Light up the sketch pen caps (of course, being an idiot, I held them with bare hands), melt them, and pour it on the components we want to stick.</p>
<p>Guess what? It worked! Also, the hot plastic burned my fingers.</p>
<p>I had both tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. Tears, because it hurt like hell. And smile, because I solved the problem.</p>
<h2 id=then-battery-run-boat-now-full-stack-web-app>Then: Battery-Run Boat, Now: Full-Stack Web App</h2><p>I've always been fascinated by the idea of building a SaaS with all the frontend, backend, data storage, Google signup/signin, payment gateway integration, etc.</p>
<p>Problem was, I'm not a coder. Building a full-stack web app seemed impossible. Then AI tools came along, and suddenly I could give it a shot.</p>
<p>For the past 30 days, I dedicated most of my time to building my first web app—a subscription tracker with built-in analytics.</p>
<p>While building this project, I learned how to</p>
<ul>
<li>Use AI tools—Claude, Bolt, and Cursor AI</li>
<li>Handle data with Supabase</li>
<li>Set up Google signup/signin</li>
<li>Make API calls</li>
<li>Integrate payment gateway</li>
</ul>
<p>I even dabbled with Docker!</p>
<p>For anyone who's familiar with coding, all these seem like kid's stuff. But for someone like me, who doesn't code, it was a really big deal!</p>
<p>At every stage, I encountered a problem that had a hundred more hidden problems in it. But I didn't give up. I faced the problems, sought help when needed, and figured out things.</p>
<p>My subscription tracker is now 95% complete. There's still an issue with the payment, but I'll either crack it myself or seek help and get it done.</p>
<p>Though I learned a great deal of things with this project, I let myself burn again. Not with hot plastic this time, but something equally damaging:</p>
<ul>
<li>I barely slept, often staying up until 3 AM, sometimes 4:30 AM, battling code issues and learning on the fly.</li>
<li>Movement? Almost none. I sat for hours straight. On top of this, I didn't eat on time. So, my health? Fucked up!</li>
<li>Also, I threw away $50+ on AI tools because I didn't know how to code but I really really wanted to build this damn thing.</li>
</ul>
<p>My work suffered too. I delivered work to my client but neglected pitching new companies and staying active on social media—things I should do as a freelancer to keep generating leads.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: I was so obsessed with building this app that I didn't notice or maybe cared about the damage—be it health, losing money, or even my work. I found joy in the burn!</p>
<h2 id=the-reality-check>The Reality Check</h2><p>Recently, my friend Vik pointed out how much time, money, and effort I've been pouring into this app.</p>
<p>I tried defending myself "It's just a one-time thing. Once it's done, I'll get back to my priorities."</p>
<p>But he saw right through me and said "This isn't the first time. It's a repeating pattern with you."</p>
<p>Reflecting on his words, I realized he was right.</p>
<p>When I become obsessed with something, I go blind to the damage it causes. I just do it, and keep doing it.</p>
<p>For instance,</p>
<ul>
<li>In 11th and 12th, I became so obsessed with Physics that I mostly did Physics and neglected Maths and Chemistry.</li>
<li>In engineering, I was obsessed with building all sorts of projects for tech fests. I stayed up late, lost money, and even neglected coursework for a while.</li>
<li>When I fell in love with writing, all I did was write. I wrote a bunch of short stories, countless poems, and even published a couple of books. The result? Couldn't secure the rank I expected in GATE. (Tbh, no regrets, just saying)</li>
<li>I bumped into no-code and built 3 mobile apps back to back. Again, neglecting the priorities.</li>
<li>I got so hooked on the novel "The Silent Patient" that I read it in one sitting, missing a work deadline.</li>
<li>And there's this forever obsession of mine—Chess, which I'm so scared to go deep into because I know I'll just sprint miles and miles without looking back even once.</li>
</ul>
<p>It was all fine as a student, but now things are different. I can't afford to abandon my priorities.</p>
<p>This realization was like a tight slap on my face. I felt ashamed, embarrassed, and hated myself for being this way.</p>
<h2 id=maybe-its-not-that-bad>Maybe It's Not That Bad</h2><p>I discussed this issue with another friend, Ruthvika—how I become so obsessed with things that I neglect what matters.</p>
<p>She listened, understood, and empathized.</p>
<p>Then she said something unexpected: "Maybe it's not that bad."</p>
<p>Though her words were comforting, I needed the reason. So, I asked, "Why do you think so?"</p>
<p>She replied, "It's because of this very nature of yours, you found what you love—writing, and made a career out of it."</p>
<p>I paused for a while. Reflected on what she said. And realized that it's true!</p>
<p>If I wasn't this way, I would have never tried writing and built a career out of it. I did it only because I was obsessed about it.</p>
<p>Then, all of a sudden, things became clear.</p>
<ul>
<li>It's because I was obsessed with building projects in engineering, I participated in tech fests held in IIT Guwahati, NIT Warangal, IIT Hyderabad, and more.</li>
<li>It's because I was obsessed with writing, I published two books and got into freelance writing.</li>
<li>It's because I was obsessed with no-code, I built 3 mobile apps.</li>
<li>It's because I was obsessed with finishing the Silent Patient novel, I read it in one go.</li>
<li>About Chess and Physics? I can't exactly tell how they helped but I'm pretty sure that a lot of credit for my logical thinking goes to them.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if I wasn't obsessed with building the full-stack web app, I wouldn't have completed 95% of it in just 30 days.</p>
<p>And if I wasn't obsessed, I wouldn't have built a battery-run boat in 7th fucking grade!</p>
<p>So yeah, this nature of mine is not that bad after all.</p>
<h2 id=but-priorities-are-priorities>But Priorities Are Priorities</h2><p>I'm 26 years old now. I've got both short-term and long-term goals to hit.</p>
<p>So, even if being obsessed about something and giving it all is not that bad, it's important that I stick to my priorities.</p>
<p>But again, I'll still tinker with hundred and one things, build projects, and do crazy things—all while making sure that I don't let go of my priorities.</p>
<p>The way I am—obsessed, getting carried away—might not be the best quality, but it did help me find things I love. And with a little tweaking, I can still be myself and build a better life.</p>
<p>So, no more self-hatred. Instead, I'll improve myself without losing the essence of who I am.</p>

<p>You pick a non-fiction book. It's about 450 pages long. You read regularly. But it's been a month and you haven't finished it yet.</p>
<p>What happens now?</p>
<p>Guilt takes over you!</p>
<p>Why? 'Coz according to most of the internet, you're supposed to finish a book in a week.</p>
<p>Go on YouTube and you'll find TED Talks like "How I read a book a day?".</p>
<p>And let's not talk about those speed reading techniques and blah blah blah.</p>
<p>For a really long time, I believed my reading pace was not up to the mark. Thanks to the internet!</p>
<p>So, I tried different reading techniques. And guess what? I hated 'em all! Why? 'Coz they ruined my reading experience!</p>
<p>Then, I just gave up on the quick reading thing. But not being able to finish a book in a week bothered me.</p>
<p>However, a few weeks ago, I bumped into a <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rvey9g0VgY0' target='_blank'>video</a> of Matt D'Avella. Matt talks to Ryan Holiday about reading and remembering what you read.</p>
<p>And Ryan drops this gem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading is a pleasurable activity, I enjoy doing it. You'd never hear someone saying "Dude I had the fastest sex" or "You should see how fast I can scarf down food at this fancy restaurant", right? I'm having a conversation with Ernest Hemingway or Marcus Aurelius. These are like the best people in the world. I wanna take my time and enjoy the conversations with them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Listening to this, all my guilt of not reading fast just vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>It's so true that when we read a book, we are having a dialogue with the author. And rushing that amazing conversation doesn't make sense. Just let it flow at its own pace!</p>
<p>So yeah, I'm finally done with the idea of reading a book a week. I'm happy that I read regularly at my own pace!</p>
<p>To guilt-free reading! ðŸ¥‚</p>

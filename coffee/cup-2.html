<p>Everything that could go wrong, went wrong today! ðŸ¥²</p>
<p>First off, I forgot to account for the cup weight. And that threw off my coffee-to-water ratio.</p>
<p>Then came the temperature problem. I tried using a body temperature gun to measure water temp. And it didn't work at all!</p>
<p>With those two variables already messed up, brew time and agitation went downhill too.</p>
<p>The only thing I got right? The grind size.</p>
<p>And here's the irony: My whole <a href='https://sreekarscribbles.com/coffee/cup-1.html' target='_blank'>experiment</a> was about keeping everything constant except grind size, and I did the exact opposite. ðŸ˜‚</p>
<p>But reflecting on this disaster, I realized a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>I gotta practice, practice, and practice! Though there are only a few steps in Aeropress brewing, I sometimes get confused.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I need to brew alone! At least, for the first few cups. There should be no one around, especially my sis, who bombarded me with a ton of questions today. And I got lost in answering them, not focusing on what I was doing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The temperature gun doesn't work. I need to get a proper thermometer.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With these things in mind, here's the change of plans:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week, I'll just focus on the process itselfâ€”getting the steps right, in the right order, without distractions. The grind size experiment? I'll pick it up next week once I've nailed the basics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>BUT......how was the coffee today?</p>
<p>Since I set the grind size to six (fine-grind) and overheated the water, the coffee turned out to be very bitter, probably due to over-extraction.</p>
<p>My tongue felt dry for almost an hour afterward, like all the saliva had evaporated and my throat turned into a desert.</p>
<p>So basically, a bad brew today!</p>
<p>But that's okay, I'll brew better tomorrow! ðŸ’ª</p>

<p>After sipping instant coffee for years, I finally bade bye to it and bought an Aeropress!</p>
<p>Today, I brewed my first cup and it was okayâ€”not that great! I screwed up the water temperature. And that affected the brewing.</p>
<p>But that's okay, I'll brew better tomorrow. At least, I figured out what went wrong. And that's not all. I also learned the variables at play in Aeropress brewing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Coffee-to-water ratio</li>
<li>Grind size</li>
<li>Brew time</li>
<li>Water temperature</li>
<li>Agitation</li>
</ol>
<p>(Thanks to <a href='https://www.instagram.com/balla.brews' target='_blank'>Aravind</a> for walking me through all these)</p>
<p>Now that I know the variables, I'm gonna play around with them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here's my plan: I'll pick one variable out of the five and change only that while keeping everything else the same for the next 6 days. And I'll document my observations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm gonna start with grind size. My coffee grinder has settings from 1 to 6. So for the next six days, I'll try a different grind size each day and log what happens. On day seven, I'll look back and figure out which grind size I liked most.</p>
<p>Tomorrow's grind size: 6.</p>

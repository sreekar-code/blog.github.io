<p>Cup #3 turned out to be a really good one. I'm so happy about it. It just made my day!</p>
<p>I followed every step, in the right way, in the right order. And I calculated everything, from coffee-to-water ratio to brew time, precisely.</p>
<p>Here's the recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee : water - 16.68g : 267 ml</li>
<li>Grind size - 4</li>
<li>Water temp - 83 °C</li>
<li>Agitation - 30 sec</li>
<li>Brew time - 60 sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Since I chose grind size 4 and 83 °C water, I could avoid over-extraction of coffee.</p>
<p>And the result? Not too sour, not too bitter; perfect cup!</p>

I had Cold Brew at Brewtique Specialty Coffee, and here's how it was:
<ul>
<li>Definitely sour, but not too sour</li>
<li>That sour taste persisted a little longer after every sip</li>
<li>Not too cold, just the right cold</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, I liked it!</p>
<p>More than the coffee, I liked being conscious while tasting coffee and taking notes on the side. It was really fun!</p>

While sipping coffee at Brewtique, I picked up the book "The World Atlas of Coffee" by James Hoffmann.
<p>I just read ten pages and fell in love with it. It's dense with info and has beautiful images.</p>
<p>Here are a few things I remember from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee comes from two major tree species: Coffea arabica (Arabica) and Coffea canephora (Robusta)</li>
<li>Arabica's coffee is smoother, slightly acidic, and lower in caffeine</li>
<li>Robusta's coffee is often bitter and stronger in taste</li>
<li>Coffee fruit in layers: Skin, pulp, parchment, silverskin, and seed</li>
<li>Two most common diseases coffee trees are prone to: Coffee Leaf Rust and Coffee Berry Borer</li>
<li>Coffee Leaf Rust creates yellow spots with orange dust on leaves, spreads easily, and causes early leaf drop</li>
<li>Coffee Berry Borer is a small beetle that burrows into cherries, ruins their taste, and makes them fall off early</li>
</ul>

I love what's happening lately. 
<p>I started with coffee brewing, but got into blogging about coffee, making notes on coffee taste, and reading about coffee.</p>
<p>This whole coffee rabbit hole is super exciting, and I'm gonna go deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>To coffee! ☕️</p>

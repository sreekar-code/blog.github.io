<p>Sounds like a coffee brand, but it isn't!</p>
<p>It's a dry, puckering feeling where your mouth feels like sandpaper.</p>
<p>I had this exact feeling when I had my <a href='https://sreekarscribbles.com/coffee/cup-2.html' target='_blank'>coffee yesterday</a>. I thought I just made a bitter coffee until <a href='https://www.instagram.com/balla.brews/#' target='_blank'>Aravind</a> corrected me. He said it's astringent coffee, not bitter.</p>
<p>Bitterness is a taste. It's one of the five basic tastes, like sweet or sour. Your taste buds pick it up as a sharp, unpleasant flavor on your tongue.</p>
<p>Astringency is different. It's a feeling, not a taste. It's that dry sensation where your mouth feels parched and rough. All the moisture seems to vanish.</p>
<p>So what causes this dry feeling?</p>
<p>Astringency happens when molecules called polyphenols in coffee bind with proteins in your saliva.</p>
<p>Since polyphenols are large molecules, they're difficult to extract from coffee beans. However, when you over-extract coffee, they come out in full force.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what happened yesterday!</p>
<p>I fine-ground beans, overheated water, and let the coffee brew for too long. Basically, I just over-extracted coffee.</p>
<p>And the result? Desert-dry feeling in my mouth.</p>
<p>To avoid astringency in the future, I need to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Grind coarser</li>
<li>Use proper water temperature</li>
<li>Keep brew time shorter</li>
</ul>
<p>Pretty simple fixes, actually.</p>
<p>As for today's coffee? I didn't brew at all. Had a long day at work.</p>
<p>But I've got a holiday tomorrow. I'll brew a cup or two peacefully.</p>

<p>It's Saturday, a holiday. And that means more coffeeeee!</p>
<p>I brewed two cups today, and both turned out to be... not so great. But that's fine—I had fun brewing, and that's all that matters for now. I'll improve gradually.</p>
<p>Here's the cup #4 recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee : water - 8.6 g : 139 ml</li>
<li>Grind size - 3</li>
<li>Water temp - 77 °C</li>
<li>Agitation - 10 sec</li>
<li>Brew time - 30 sec</li>
</ul>
<p>Taste: Not sour, not bitter. Very light. (I didn't like it)</p>
<p>I deliberately ground the coffee coarser, heated the water below the ideal range (80-96 °C), and kept the brew time and agitation to a minimum.</p>
<p>I did this to get a sour-flavored coffee. Instead, it just turned out to be light coffee with no flavor whatsoever.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<br>
<p>To give another shot, I brewed cup #5 with a tweaked recipe:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coffee : water - 10 g : 160 ml</li>
<li>Grind size: 3</li>
<li>Water temp - 70 °C</li>
<li>Agitation - 10 sec</li>
<li>Brew time - 30 sec</li>
</ul>
<p>For some reason, it was better than cup #4. And I don't know why.</p>
<p>However, I <em>still</em> couldn't get that sour-flavored coffee I was chasing.</p>
<br>
<hr />
<br>
<p>After two failed attempts and a quick chat with <a href='https://www.instagram.com/balla.brews/#' target='_blank'>Aravind</a>, I finally understood the problem: It wasn't the recipe; it was the coffee beans themselves.</p>
<p>I'd ordered dark roast beans, and it's hard to get a sour-flavored coffee with them.</p>
<p>Dark roasts have simpler, bolder flavor profiles with less acidity. Light roast beans, on the other hand, have a much larger spectrum of flavors—bright, crisp, and acidic.</p>
<p>So, next time, my money goes into light roast beans!</p>

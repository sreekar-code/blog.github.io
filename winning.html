<p>I'm watching Haikyu these days. It's an anime about Volleyball with an engaging story, inspiring characters, and dialogues that give you goosebumps.</p>
<p>In one of the episodes, there's a dialogue that hit me hard. But before I reveal it, I need to give you some context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are 2 characters—Daichi Sawamura and Hayato Ikejiri. They were teammates in junior high school.</p>
<p>Once they lost a Volleyball match against a tough opponent. Everyone on their team, including Hayato, expected that outcome and didn't feel bad about it.</p>
<p>But Daichi was so upset with that loss that he cried!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at Daichi, Hayato says to himself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are the only one who is upset by it. I don't know why but part of me is jealous you could feel that way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I first heard this dialogue, I just paused the episode and remained silent. I realized that it's been a long time since I felt the way Daichi did after that loss.</p>
<p>Though I didn't play sports much, I was super competitive when it came to academics. I'd go the extra mile even if it's for just one mark and feel bad if I lose it.</p>
<p>But all this changed when I was hospitalized during ninth grade. That year, everyone around me said it was okay even if I didn't get good marks.</p>
<p>I understand why they said that—they just wanted me to recover without worrying too much about grades.</p>
<p>But that didn't stop there, they continued to say the same in the following years. I heard people saying "It's okay" a million times whenever I couldn't do something.</p>
<p>Of course, that's what your loved ones would say to cheer you up. I say the same to my loved ones.</p>
<p>But too much of this "It's okay" slowly takes away your drive to win. That's exactly what happened to me.</p>
<p>Though I secured good grades throughout my student years, I became less driven. I was okay with not achieving what I wanted.</p>
<p>However, things changed when I switched careers and got into freelancing but I still feel I'm not as driven as I once used to be.</p>
<p>Much like Hayato, now I find myself jealous of my younger self who could genuinely feel disappointment over losing a mark.</p>
<p>But the game isn't over yet, and I can still become as driven as I once was, or maybe even more.</p>
<p>I just need to remember that it's okay to lose sometimes but not be okay with losing. I've got to focus on winning again!</p>

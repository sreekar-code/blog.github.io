<p>It's been 2.5 years since I started running, and it has now become an integral part of my life.</p>
<p>Everything falls into place when I go for a run—I eat well, sleep well, and work well.</p>
<p>Recently, I lost my job, and it wasn't easy to overcome that trauma. I tried different activities like watching movies, reading novels, and going out, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>I got back to work, which helped a bit, but I still couldn't establish a routine, and other aspects of my life remained messy.</p>
<p>So, I returned to the one thing that has always helped me—running. And in no time, I started feeling better both physically and mentally.</p>
<p>I'm eternally grateful for this simple activity that makes my life a lot easier.</p>
<p>This December, I challenged myself to run 50 km. I have completed 17.6 km so far. I still need to run a few more kilometers, and I'm confident I can do it.</p>
<p>I post my running progress on <a href='https://x.com/sreekar_writer' target='_blank'>Twitter</a>; you can follow me there! :)</p>

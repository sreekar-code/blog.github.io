<p>Tomorrow, I'm going on my first solo trip. And unlike my super-organized luggage, my mind's a mess now! ðŸ¥²</p>
<p>Random thoughts like<br />
-what if I miss the train?<br />
-what if I board the wrong train?<br />
-what if I lose my mobile?<br />
-what if I get robbed?<br />
-what if the train halts at a random station due to heavy rains?<br />
on and on....are running in my mind at full throttle!</p>
<p>And the bonus: headache + nervousness + whatnot!</p>
<p>While these wild thoughts driving me crazy, I just remembered a newsletter issue of Ankur Wariko that I read a year ago.</p>
<p>Ankur explained the concept of possibilities vs probabilities.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We often tend to assume the worst possibilities without considering their probabilities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And guess what? Most times, the probability of the worst possibility is less!</p>
<p>So, all we do is worry about the thing that's least likely to happen.</p>
<p>And recollecting this nugget of wisdom amidst all this chaos was really comforting! ðŸ˜Œ</p>
<p>I just realized that all those overwhelming "what-ifs" were actually possibilities with fewer probabilities.</p>
<p>It's just my mind playing tricks with me, and I, like an idiot, falling into its trap over and over.</p>
<p>But not anymore!</p>
<p>I'm not gonna ruin my peace of mind for something that may not even occur.</p>
<p>So, f*ck it! I'm going on a solo trip tomorrow! And I'm gonna have loads and loads of fun!</p>
<p>And even if some shit happens, I WILL FIGURE IT OUT!!</p>

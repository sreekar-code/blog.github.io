  <p>How can we detach ourselves from work?</p>
<p>First, let's be honest. Most of us work 9 hours a day. And there are people who work even more. No judging, we all know how things are these days.</p>
<p>So, 9 hours! Now that's more than one-third of the day.</p>
<p>And when you spend so much time on work, you'll obviously have work-related thoughts in the rest of the day too.</p>
<p>So, how the fuck can we detach ourselves from work?</p>
<p>Now if you say do sketching, read a book, or cook a dish, I'm just gonna walk away. No seriously, I'm tired of hearing this shit.</p>
<p>After having a long day, trust me, no one will have the energy to do any of those.</p>
<p>So again, how can we detach ourselves from work?</p>
<p>Honestly, I don't know. But I'll share what's working for me.</p>
<p>3 things. One, music. Two, friends. Three, Instagram.</p>
<p>First, music. Headphones, not earphones and not earpods, proper headphones, with songs having beautiful lyrics, and I can just forget everything else. It's so so soo relaxing!</p>
<p>Second, friends. I feel a cup of chai followed by a walk with a friend can cure cancer too. Shit we talk—is refreshing!</p>
<p>Third, Instagram. Okay, I get it. It's doomscrolling. It's unhealthy. It's waste of time. Blah blah blah. But, it takes my mind off work. That's it, not gonna say anything more.</p>
<p>So, these things are working for me to stay away from work.</p>
<p>But this doesn't mean I don't pick up books or do sketching. I do. But when I have the energy. Like now, writing this blog post! :)</p>

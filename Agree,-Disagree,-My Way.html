<p>It's so easy to be swayed by the words of someone successful. And when that someone is Derek Sivers, you don't even give it a second thought. You just agree!</p>
<p>I read one of <a href='https://sive.rs/tp1' target='_blank'>Derek's blog posts</a>, where he discussed his travel experience in Seoul with no mobile.</p>
<p>Derek said "It was a relief to not document everything. I appreciated everything as a one-step process instead of a two-step process. I could just feel amazed, instead of feel amazed and hold up my camera to record it."</p>
<p>Okay, I "agree" with Derek! It's beautiful to live in the moment, instead of trying to capture it.</p>
<p>But guess what? I bumped into one of the comments, where a counter-argument was proposed.</p>
<p>Here it is ‚¨áÔ∏è</p>

<p><a href='https://xkcd.com/1314/' target='_blank'>image source</a></p>
<p>Okay, now, what do you think about Derek's words? Do you still agree with him? Well, I kind of "disagree" now! üòÖ</p>
<p>It's beautiful to live in the moment but capturing it doesn't entirely take away its essence. It may even make the experience more beautiful!</p>
<p>So, after these agree-disagree moments, I realized a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can evaluate the soundness of an argument only when you solely focus on the argument and not who said it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Everyone has their own way of experiencing and appreciating things. You don't have to feel guilty if your way doesn't match with others.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And these realizations led me to find "my way".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I wanna document things when I feel like it. And when I don't, I'll just live in the moment. In either case, no guilt!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Btw, I'm going on my first solo trip today. And I'm gonna enjoy every moment and document a few!</p>
<p>So, stay tuned! Travel talks and pictures are on your way!</p>

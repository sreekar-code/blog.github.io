<p>Reading Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman, I realized that Feynman and I shared the same playful idea.</p>
<p>Feynman, as a kid, hated Trigonometry symbols. So, he invented his own—like a sigma with an overstretching arm for sine. He also created symbols for cosine, tan, and more.</p>
<p>Similar to Feynman, I hated expressing area in square centimetres as a kid. So, I came up with triangle centimetres instead.</p>
<p>Here's how my units—triangle centimetres work:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Take a 5x2 rectangle. Its area is 10 square centimetres. This means 10 squares of 1cm each fit in the rectangle.</p>
<p>Each square, when cut diagonally, gives a pair of triangles. So, for 10 squares, you get 20 triangles.</p>
<p>Now, the area of 5x2 rectangle can be expressed as 20 triangle centimetres.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Though my units worked, I hit the same wall Feynman did.</p>
<p>Feynman once solved a problem for another student using his symbols. The other kid couldn’t follow any of it.</p>
<p>That’s when Feynman saw that his symbols only made sense to him. He learned that sharing ideas needs common symbols.</p>
<p>I ran into something similar. No other kid used triangle centimetres. And though my teacher liked my creativity, she insisted that I stick to standard units.</p>
<p>Reading Feynman’s story brought all this back. And finding this shared childhood quirk with a famous physicist felt oddly satisfying.</p>

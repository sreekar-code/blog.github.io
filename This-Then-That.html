 <p>Study then play.<br />
Earn then travel.<br />
Settle then find love.<br />
This then that. And then another. And then another.</p>
<p>That's what my parents, school, society—everyone taught me! First, do "this" and then "that".</p>
<p>But guess what?</p>
<p>I still gotta study more.<br />
I still gotta earn more.<br />
I still gotta settle well.</p>
<p>And when will I do "that". Or will I do "that" ever? Never! Because there's always some "this" to be done.</p>
<p>So, how do I do "that"?</p>
<p>Well, there's only one way—do "this" as well as "that"! "That" is not a reward for "this". "That" is just an experience like "this".</p>
<p>So,</p>
<p>I'm gonna study as well as play.<br />
I'm gonna earn as well as travel.<br />
I'm gonna settle as well as find love.</p>
<p>I'm gonna do "this" as well as "that"!</p>
<p>Your parents, school, and society taught what they thought was right. But you know what? A few of the things they taught might be wrong or outdated. So, unlearn and try things in a different way.</p>
<p>Sometimes, only unlearning opens doors to new experiences!</p>

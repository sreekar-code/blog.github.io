<p>On a hilltop in Lonavala, literally in clouds, while the fresh, cool breeze soothing my soul, I thought "This is the best moment of my trip". But I was wrong.</p>
<p>While I was descending the hill, I received an email saying I landed the job I applied for a few days before. I was pretty sure that was the best moment of my trip. But little did I know I was wrong again.</p>
<p>Two months later, I was fired for no proper reason. They deleted my Google account right after the call and wiped out all my data without any notice period.</p>
<p>Everything happened so quickly that I could hardly react to anything. I was just numb!</p>
<p>The next few days were rough. My confidence hit rock bottom. I was overwhelmed with self-doubt. I had anxiety attacks. In simple words, I was a total mess!</p>
<p>I tried to distract myself by going out, watching movies, and meeting friends, but nothing worked.</p>
<p>I even tried to pause everything, stay still, and do nothing. But that didn't work either. It made me more anxious.</p>
<p>So, after multiple failed attempts, I tried taking action.</p>
<p>I resumed my workout routine. Trust me, it wasn't easy. The weights I usually lift felt heavier and the same distance I used to run felt never-ending. But I did it anyway.</p>
<p>I got back to work too. I revamped my portfolio, updated my resume, gave a fresh look to my LinkedIn & Twitter, prepared a pricing chart, and finalized the type of clients I'd like to target.</p>
<p>I'm making progress, slow and steady. And I'm confident that I'll pick up the pace in the coming days.</p>
<p>For me, in this situation, neither distraction nor inaction helped, it's only the action that's healing me.</p>
<p>But I don't say taking action works every single time. In the past, I solved some of my problems through distraction and even inaction.</p>
<p>So, take action, take no action, or distractionâ€”none of these is a one-stop solution. We just gotta try and see what works for each situation.</p>

<p>I love my blog! I really do! I want to write every day. But I don't. Why? Because of the Perfection Bug!</p>

<p>"You need to share a unique thought"</p>

<p>"Your idea should be worth penning"</p>

<p>"You need to write in great detail"</p>

<p>Buzz, buzzz, buzzzz....the perfection bug keeps buzzing in my ear.</p>

<p>But today, I decided to squash that bug!</p>

<p>I don't need unique thoughts. I don't need amazing ideas. I don't need to explain things in detail.<p/>

<p>All I need is a thought (which can be ordinary) and a bunch of words to share it. That's it! That's all I need to write on my blog.</p>

<p>So, see you again tomorrow with an ordinary thought and a bunch of words!</p>

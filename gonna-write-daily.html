<p>Although I'm a freelance content writer, I don't write every day.</p>
<p>This is because I need to do other tasks such as prospecting, networking, studying trends, and more.</p>
<p>I enjoy these activities but not writing daily is making me a bit rusty at my craft. So, I decided to write every day on my blog.</p>
<p>I know that coming up with new ideas and writing quality content daily is difficult, so I don't want to stress about it and just write whatever I feel like.</p>
<p>With that said, you can look forward to new blog posts coming soon. Stay tuned!</p>

 <p>I love meeting people who are 8-10X better than me. However, I often find it challenging to strike up an engaging conversation with them.</p>
<p>This is because when I meet such people, the thought "They're better than me and I'm nowhere near them" creeps into my mind, and before I know it, I’ve put them on a pedestal.</p>
<p>For a long time, I struggled with the question: How not to put people I admire on a pedestal. But I finally found the answer to it. All thanks to Haikyu—an anime about Volleyball.</p>
<p>So far, I've watched ~30 episodes of Haikyu and I didn't come across a single player who said "You're better than me and I'm nowhere near you".</p>
<p>Every player, even when they knew they were going to lose badly, said "I'll kick your ass!" to their opponents.</p>
<p>Listening to this dialogue over and over from different players in Haikyu, I realized that no matter how strong your opponent is, you still need to believe that you can kick their ass!</p>
<p>Yes, it's a delusion (for now). But you still need to believe in it!</p>
<p>Why? Because that's the only way you can get rid of the inferior-superior feeling and not put them on a pedestal.</p>
<p>This boosts your confidence, reduces friction, and allows you to get along with the people you admire more easily.</p>
<p>So, the next time I meet someone who is 8-10X better than me, I wouldn't encourage thoughts like I'm nowhere near them and blah blah but instead I'll believe that I can kick their ass (someday), and talk to them with confidence!</p>

<p>I've always been a fan of Spotify. Its UI, UX, features â€” I just love 'em all!</p>
<p>Recently, I heard from one of my friends that a web series about Spotify has been released. And guess what? I was actually looking forward to something like this 'coz I always wanted to know the backstory of Spotify.</p>
<p>So, with no further ado, I started watching the series "The Playlist". (perfect title btw)</p>
<p>Out of 6 episodes, I finished 3. And so far, it's brilliant!</p>
<p>There's this unique element I loved about this series: showing every side of the story!</p>
<p>Whenever you're presented with a story, the question â€” What's the other side of this story? â€“ pops up in your mind. And most of the storytellers don't disclose it.</p>
<p>However, it's not the case with "The Playlist". You get to know different sides of the story. Everyone â€” the founder, the partner, the coder, the investor, the lawyer, the artist â€” all of 'em share their side of the story.</p>
<p>And I loved this offbeat storytelling! ðŸ«¶</p>
<p>From coder to marketer to founder to investor, everyone's a hero in a startup. The Playlist reflects this fact beautifully!</p>
<p>And watching this series, I realized something.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It's this little effort in trying out something different that actually makes all the difference!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The creators of the series could have gone with traditional storytelling, instead, they chose a different form of storytelling, and it turned out to be f*cking awesome!</p>
<p>To offbeat storytelling, to startups, to Spotify, to The Playlist ðŸ¥‚</p>
<p>Okay, gotta watch 3 more episodes. Will catch you later, byeeee!</p>

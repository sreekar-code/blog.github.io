 <p>"I just finished this podcast. And it's amazing!"</p>
<p>"Guess what? I read that book in one-go!"</p>
<p>"I watched this Harvard lecture and it's mind-blowing!"</p>
<p>I hear these from my friends all the time. And it creates a hell lot of FOMO!</p>
<p>They consume crazy good content. They binge-read books, listen to podcasts while exercising, and watch lectures during lunch.</p>
<p>I do none of those!</p>
<p>I don't binge-read books (I tried but just couldn't). I don't listen to podcasts while exercising (not even music). And I don't watch Harvard lectures during lunch (I watch sitcoms ðŸ˜…).</p>
<p>But I do read 30 mins a day. I do listen to podcasts occasionally. And I do watch interesting lectures on YouTube once in a while.</p>
<p>Yet, the FOMO kicks in! And I'm okay with it. I don't push myself to consume more content to keep up with my friends.</p>
<p>But isnâ€™t that all valuable content? Shouldnâ€™t I take out time to consume more? My brain asks this time and again.</p>
<p>And every time, I say Nooooooo!!</p>
<p>Why? Because though the content is valuable, it's neither urgent nor necessary to consume!</p>
<p>The content stays on the internet. I can listen to that podcast throughout the week, read that book in 30 days, and watch those lectures on weekends. Or I don't. And that's okay too!</p>
<p>My reminder: Let the world run, I'll walk, just walk! ðŸ˜Œ</p>

<p>I just had a 2.5-hour-long conversation with one of my friends. From movies to books and relationships to parentingâ€”we discussed a ton of things!</p>
<p>While we were discussing parenting, I said "I don't wanna have kids. But if I have, I'd take 50% responsibility for the kid and expect my partner to share the rest. So, it's 50:50!".</p>
<p>Then, my friend said, "Dude! It's never 50:50!".</p>
<p>And I was like "What??".</p>
<p>He continued "Parenting is never 50:50, sometimes it's 80:20, other times it's 60:40, and at times it's 20:80. So, if you wanna be a good parent, you gotta be willing to put in that extra effort without complaining".</p>
<p>Okay, none of us is a parent now but his point really made sense to me. It's so true!</p>
<p>And guess what? It's true for every relationship!</p>
<p>Sometimes, you gotta put in that extra effort and your willingness to do that will sustain your relationship longer.</p>
<p>So, it's never 50:50!</p>
